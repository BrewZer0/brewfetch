# Brewfetch
Brewy's crap attempt at making a neofetch for old machines.

this is my own neofetch written with very old distros in mind (like Debian 4 and such) in bash with compatible-ish scripts. 

WARNING: Modern OSes May not have the right settings in order to display the processor and/or the OS because they depend on /etc/issue and /proc/cpuinfo for displaying them. because both files are mostly updated, it may won't work. feel free to Pull request me in case you fixed the issue.
